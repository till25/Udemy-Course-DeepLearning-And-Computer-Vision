## Overview

In this repository we have:
1. Emotion classification
##Find the dataset here
https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data
2. Face detector
3. Multiclass classification of images
4. Flask serving
5. OpenCV for images and video processing
6. Python and Numpy basics
7. Style Transfer
8. Snipe program, to be used for face detection

As a result of the short-term state representation, the models are not state-of-the-art level, but we shall get there eventually.


## Running the Code

To run the codes you will have to open them in jupyter notebook except for flask, which you will have to use any code editor you choose.
